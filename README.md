## Hi there 👋

I am an individual with boundless curiosity, particularly in the realm of technology. This innate curiosity has consistently driven me to explore the inner workings of things and determine my capacity to accomplish them. It was through my decision to delve into the realm of indie games development that I unearthed a genuine passion: programming. I thoroughly enjoy creating both games and web applications that provide enjoyable and/or engaging user experiences, and I am constantly receptive to new projects.
